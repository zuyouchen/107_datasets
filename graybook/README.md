# Illinois Graybook (Salary) Data

Updated for 2022-2023. 

graybook-sp23.csv has all raw data.

Cleaned version (graybook-clean-sp23.csv) has only one row per employee, employee titles and employee classes grouped into new cols. 

graybook-clean-sp23.csv has all departments except for the Divisions of Collegiate Athletics. This is to allow students to generate more meaningful plots in the lab.
